# NetworkingTCPClientEchoOriginal
The first part to making a client and sever. The code currently will currently send data from a client to a sever and then send it back. This is based on the work done by Shafiq

NOTE: Files SocketServer and Sockets programme were based off the in the lesson 9 sockets solution. I was unable to make it two way or multiclient. File OldClientServer contains my own implementation off of what I've read, but I still was unable to make it two way or multiclient. I will add a new client and server program once I have figured it out

UPDATE: The file NewClientServer contains the updated TCP/IP sockets and servers, and it works as expected.
